MICRO_GPS_Hardware_Serial
=========================
Sketch uses Arduino MICRO and modified Adafruit's Ultimate GPS  
libraries. I have modified the standard Adafruit_GPS library to fully
support Global Tops's Antenna Status protocol. This sketch intefaces
Adafruit's Ultimate GPS using a hardware serial inteface and fully
supports the use of Adafruit's active GPS antenna.
